# Phone DB Rust

Database of phone numbers with API for access by phone system.

# Development

Your new jumpstart project includes basic organization with an organized `assets` folder and a `components` folder.
If you chose to develop with the router feature, you will also have a `views` folder.

## Getting Started

### Tailwind
1. Install npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
2. Install the Tailwind CSS CLI: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
3. Run the following command in the root of the project to start the Tailwind CSS compiler:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./assets/tailwind.css --watch
```

### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve --platform web
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```

## CLI Tools

### Data Linter

The project includes a CLI tool to validate database records and check for data inconsistencies. See [docs/LINT.md](docs/LINT.md) for details.

Quick usage with Nix:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/phone_db nix run .#lint
```

Or with Cargo:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/phone_db
./lint.sh
```
